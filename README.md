Installation
------------

### As a standalone project

#### 1. Use the installer:

    gem install alchemy_cms
    alchemy new my_magicpage
    cd my_magicpage

**Temporarily*** you have to add the following gem into your Gemfile:

    # Remove this after the new version (1.0.3) was released https://github.com/alexspeller/non-stupid-digest-assets/
    gem 'non-stupid-digest-assets', github: 'alexspeller/non-stupid-digest-assets', branch: 'master'

*) This line can be safely removed, if the new version of the gem `non-stupid-digest-assets` will be released.

Run

    bundle install

to finish installation process.

#### 2. Start the local server:

    bin/rails server

#### 3. Switch to your browser:

Open `http://localhost:3000` and follow the on screen instructions.

### Into an existing Rails project

#### 1. Add the Alchemy gem:

In your App's Gemfile:

    gem 'alchemy_cms', github: 'magiclabs/alchemy_cms', branch: 'master'
    # Remove this after the new version (1.0.3) was released https://github.com/alexspeller/non-stupid-digest-assets/
    gem 'non-stupid-digest-assets', github: 'alexspeller/non-stupid-digest-assets', branch: 'master'

#### 2. Install Alchemy into your app:

Run in terminal:

    bundle install
    bin/rake alchemy:install

### Authentication User Model

With Version 3.0 we extracted the Alchemy user model [into its own gem](https://github.com/magiclabs/alchemy-devise).

In order to get the former Alchemy user model back, add the following gem into your Gemfile:

    gem 'alchemy-devise', github: 'magiclabs/alchemy-devise', branch: 'master'

Run in terminal:

    bundle install
    bin/rake alchemy_devise:install:migrations db:migrate

**In order to use your own user model, you can add e.g.**

    # config/initializers/alchemy.rb
    Alchemy.user_class_name = 'YourUserClass'
    Alchemy.login_path = '/your/login/path'
    Alchemy.logout_path = '/your/logout/path'


Upgrading
---------

After updating the Alchemy gem in your App, you should run the upgrader.

Run in terminal:

    bin/rake alchemy:upgrade
