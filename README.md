Tipps
-----

1. This generator creates all necessary folders and files needed for creating your own page layouts and elements for your website:

        rails generate alchemy:scaffold

2. If you use the ferret full text search (enabled by default), then please add a job to your crontab that reindexes the ferret index.

        cd /path/to/your/alchemy && RAILS_ENV=production rake ferret:rebuild_index > /dev/null

3. You can easily create your element files (for view and editor) depending on the `elements.yml` with this generator:

        rails generate elements
