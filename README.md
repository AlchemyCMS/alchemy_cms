Installation
------------

### As a standalone project

#### 1. Use the installer:

    gem install alchemy_cms
    alchemy new my_magicpage
    cd my_magicpage

Run

    bundle install

to finish installation process.

#### 2. Start the local server:

    bin/rails server

#### 3. Switch to your browser:

Open `http://localhost:3000` and follow the on screen instructions.

### Into an existing Rails project

#### 1. Add the Alchemy gem:

In your App's Gemfile:

    gem 'alchemy_cms', github: 'magiclabs/alchemy_cms', branch: 'master'

#### 2. Install Alchemy into your app:

Run in terminal:

    bundle install
    bin/rake alchemy:install

### Authentication User Model

With Version 3.0 we extracted the Alchemy user model [into its own gem](https://github.com/magiclabs/alchemy-devise).

In order to get the former Alchemy user model back, add the following gem into your Gemfile:

    gem 'alchemy-devise', github: 'magiclabs/alchemy-devise', branch: 'master'

Run in terminal:

    bundle install
    bin/rake alchemy_devise:install:migrations db:migrate

**In order to use your own user model, you can add e.g.**

    # config/initializers/alchemy.rb
    Alchemy.user_class_name = 'YourUserClass'
    Alchemy.login_path = '/your/login/path'
    Alchemy.logout_path = '/your/logout/path'

The only thing Alchemy needs to know from your user model is the `alchemy_roles` method.

This method has to return an `Array` or `ActiveRecord::Relation` with at least one of the following roles:

* `member`
* `author`
* `editor`
* `admin`

Example:

    def alchemy_roles
      self.admin?
        %w(admin)
      end
    end

**Optionally** you can add a `alchemy_display_name` method that returns a name representing the currently logged in user. This is used in the admin views.

Example:

    def alchemy_display_name
      "#{first_name} #{last_name}".strip
    end

Testing
-------

Before running tests (which refer to Alchemy), please make sure to run the rake task

    bundle exec rake alchemy:spec:prepare

to set up the database for testing.

Now you can run your tests, e. g. with RSpec:

    bundle exec rspec spec/...

**Alternatively** you can just run:

    bundle exec rake

This default task executes the database preparations and runs all defined test cases.

Deployment
----------

Alchemy ships with a generator that creates a Capistrano `config/deploy.rb` file, which
takes care of everything you need to deploy an Alchemy site.

So, if you don't have your own deploy file, we encourage you to use this generator:

    $ bin/rails g alchemy:deploy_script

If you have your own Capistrano receipts, you should require the Alchemy tasks in your app's `config/deploy.rb` file:

    # deploy.rb
    require 'alchemy/capistrano'

If you don't use Capistrano you have to **make shure that the `uploads`, `tmp/cache/assets`, `public/assets` and `public/pictures` cache folders get shared** between deployments, otherwise you **will loose data**.

Please take a look into the `lib/alchemy/capistrano.rb` file, to see how to achieve this.

Upgrading
---------

After updating the Alchemy gem in your App, you should run the upgrader.

Run in terminal:

    bin/rake alchemy:upgrade
