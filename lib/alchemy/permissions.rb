module Alchemy

  # ## Alchemy's permissions
  #
  # These are CanCan abilities, but to prevent any naming collusions we named it permissions.
  #
  # Alchemy user rules are modules that can be included in your app's/engine's Ability class.
  #
  # ### Example:
  #
  #     # app/models/ability.rb
  #     class Ability
  #       include CanCan::Ability
  #       include Alchemy::Permissions::EditorUser
  #
  #       def initialize(user)
  #         return if user.nil?
  #         @user ||= user
  #         if @user.has_role?(:demo)
  #           alchemy_editor_rules # alchemy editor roles
  #           # your own rules
  #         end
  #       end
  #
  #     end
