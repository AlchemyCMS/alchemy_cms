# = Configuration

# == This is the global Alchemy configuration file
# Please override your apps settings in your config/alchemy/config.yml file.
# You can use a handy rake task to generate it.
#
#   rake alchemy:app_structure:create:config

# The amount of time of inactivity in minutes after which the user is kicked out of his current session.
# Only active in production environment!!!
:auto_logout_time: 30

# === Redirect options
# redirect_index: You can set to redirect (an 301 permanent, for all you SEO geeks ^_^) to first child page (typically the homepage) the index/intro page if it's not visible.
# So you don't get an 404 error if the language root page is not visible.
# redirect_to_public_child: Alchemy redirects to the first public child page found, if a page is not visible.
:redirect_index: true
:redirect_to_public_child: true

# Enabling the Ferret fulltext search engine.
# Tip! For best performance and stability install a crontab that reindexes ferrets search index periodly.
# Example: cd ~/html/alchemy/current && RAILS_ENV=production rake ferret:rebuild_index
:ferret: true

# === Pagecaching
# Enable/Disable pagecaching globally.
# Hint: You can enable/disable page caching for single Alchemy::PageLayouts in the page_layout.yml file.
:cache_pages: true

# === Sitemap
# Alchemy renders a nice HTML (<ul><li> style) and XML (Google conform!) Sitemap for you.
# Just place a sitemap element for a page layout in your page_layouts.yml file. Alchemy does the rest.
# ==== Options:
# show_root: Show language root page in sitemap?
# show_flag: enables the Checkbox in Page#update overlay. So your customer can set the visibilit of pages in the sitemap.
:sitemap: 
  :show_root: true
  :show_flag: false

# === URL nesting
# By default Alchemy does not nest page urls respectivley to their page tree position.
# Enable +url_nesting+ to get nested urls.
# ==== Example of a nested url:
# +http://homepage.com/company/history/the-early-years+
# Alchemy supports url nesting up to three levels deep. We think that's more then enough,
# because URLs like this are possible:
# +http://homepage.com/en/2011/12/08/my-post
url_nesting: false

# === Picture rendering settings
# Alchemy uses Fleximage and RMagick to render images. Use {:image_size => "XXXxYYY", :crop => BOOLEAN [true]} to resize images.
# See https://github.com/Squeegy/fleximage for further infos.
# ==== Options:
# output_image_jpg_quality: If rendered as JPG this is the quality setting for it.
# preprocess_image_resize: Large images are downsized after upload to save diskspace.
# image_store_format: Masterimage storage format. Images are rendered from this master image, so a lossless format (png) is strongly recommended.
# image_output_format: Globally image output format setting.
# TIP: You can always override the output format in the options of your Essence. I.e. {:format => :gif}
:output_image_jpg_quality: 85
:preprocess_image_resize: 1000x1000
:image_store_format: png
:image_output_format: jpg

# 
# To send Mails via contact forms you can create your form fields here and set which fields are to be validated.
#

# 
# ==== Translating validation messages:
# 
# The message_id is passed through Alchemy::I18n.t so you can translate it in your language yml file.

#   de:  
#     alchemy:
#      contactform:
#         validations:
#           enter_name: 'Bitte geben Sie einen Namen an'
