# == In this configuration you setup Alchemy´s element layouts.
# 
# *Notice. Please place your own version of this file inside +RAILS_ROOT/config/alchemy/+.*
# 
# Elements containing all necessary basic tools for displaying and editing content inside Alchemy.
# They consists of composed contents (different essence-types) as shown in the illustration of an elements-sheme below.
#
# == Schema of an element
# 
#   =================================
#   #  Content 1 (EssenceText)      #
#   #                               #
#   #  Content 2 (EssencePicture)   #
#   #                               #
#   #  Content 3 (EssenceRichtext)  #
#   =================================
#
# == Example of a basic element layout
# 
#   - name: a_unique_name (Used for the partial name in +app/views/elements+ and translated as Element.display_name)
#     unique: Bool //pass true if this element only can be displayed once on page
#     contents:
#     - name: head
#       type: EssenceText
#     - name: text
#       type: EssenceRichtext
#
# As already mentioned above, there are different content-types wich can be defined for each content in an element.
# Defining these types is used to render predefined views in the element.
#
# == Content-Types:
#
# * EssenceText               (Used to store a String (max. 255 Chars.) i.e. a headline, or productname. The editor is renderd as a single-lined input field. The view output will be sanitized and escaped. So it's XSS save.)
# * EssenceRichtext           (Used to store editable richtext. Editor is rendered as a textarea with TinyMCE Editor.)
# * EssencePicture            (Used to store picture ids from pictures assigned through the library. The editor is rendered as a picture-editor collection with a lot of options (i.e. image cropper). The view renders the assigned picture, resizes it, crops it and caches the result.)
# * EssenceFlash              (Used to store attachment ids from attachments assigned through the library. The view renders an embeded object.)
# * EssenceDate               (Used to store a DateTime object. The view output is passed through Rails I18n Library, so it will be fully localized.)
# * EssenceHtml               (Used to store a String (max. 255 Chars.). The view output renders the raw, not sanitized or unescaped String. So be carefull!)
# 
# After finishing the setup of your element layouts, you need to generate the files for the elements before using them in Alchemy.
# For creating these files, use the following command in your terminal:
# 
#   script/generate elements
# 
# All new elements will be created as two different partials in RAILS_ROOT/app/views/elements.
# For each element there is an editor-view wich will be rendered when editing them in Alchemy and another view for the website´s frontend.
# 
#   app/views/elements/_elementsname_editor.html.erb
#   app/views/elements/_elementsname_view.html.erb
# 
# For most contents in an element you can specify additional options, so they get rendered in a specific way.
# These options can be defined as symbols, but its too much to list them up here.
# You can find these options described in the application_helper.rb, most of them at the render_essence method.
#
# == Setting a content as preview-text for the element
# 
# You can set a content-essence as preview-text for its element like this
# take_me_for_preview: true
#
#
# == Adding contents dynamically in the frontend
# 
# You are able to add content-essences dynamically to the element from the Alchemy frontend.
# You just have to make contents available for adding them.
# This example enables this feature
# 
#   - name: headline
#     unique: false
#     contents:
#     - name: headline
#       type: EssenceText
#     - name: big_text
#       type: EssenceRichtext
#     available_contents:
#     - name: big_text
#       type: EssenceRichtext
#
# Now an Alchemy user can add the content 'big_text' from the element as much as desired.
#
# == Validations:
#   
#   You can validate the presence of a content. Just pass validate and one of the supported vaidatiosn methods to your content definition:
#     
#     - name: article
#       display_name: Standard-Artikel
#       contents:
#       - name: intro
#         type: EssenceText
#         validate: [presence]
#     
# Now the user has to enter a value inside of the intro EssenceText textfield to save the element.
# Currently supported validations are:
# 
#    * presence
#    * uniqueness
#
